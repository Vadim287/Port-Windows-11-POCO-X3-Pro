### Notes
>
> [!WARNING]  
> All your data will be erased! Back up now if needed.
>
> Do not run the same command twice.
>
> DO NOT REBOOT YOUR PHONE if you think you made a mistake, ask for help in the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/WaLoVayu).
>
> Do not run all commands at once, execute them in order!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you use the MODDED Recovery throughout this whole tutorial as we provide tools to help aid this installation process and make it as easy as possible for you.
>
> If you don't use it and you face any errors, consider it your fault and consider yourself alone if you try asking for support as you have deferred from the main guide.

### Opening CMD as an admin
>
> Download **platform-tools** and extract the folder somewhere, then open CMD as an **administrator**.
>
> It is recommended to keep this window open and use it throughout the entire guide.
>
> Replace `path\to\platform-tools` with the actual path to the platform-tools folder, for example **C:\platform-tools**.

```cmd
cd path\to\platform-tools
```

### Flash the modded recovery
>
> While in fastboot mode, replace `path\to\moddedtwrp.img` with the actual path to the modded recovery image

```cmd
fastboot flash recovery path\to\moddedtwrp.img reboot recovery
```

### Backing up your boot image
>
> This will back up your boot image in the current directory

```cmd
adb pull /dev/block/by-name/boot boot.img
```

### Flashing latest firmware
>
> [!Important]
> It is mandatory to flash the latest firmware (this does not affect your current ROM).

- Download the **fw_vayu_miui_VAYUGlobal_V14.0.3.0.TJUMIXM_6be397120d_13.0.zip** and put it somewhere on your phone.
- Select the **Install** button in TWRP, locate the firmware file, then install it.
- There is no need to reboot yet, stay in TWRP for the next few steps.

### Enter adb shell

```cmd
adb shell
```

- Run the partitioning script `If it asks you to run it once again, do so`

```cmd
partition
```

- Fix the GPT `Or Windows may brick your device`

```cmd
fixgpt
```

- Exit adb shell

```cmd
exit
```

### Formatting data

- Format all data in TWRP, or Android will not boot.
- ( Go to Wipe > Format data > type yes )

### Check if Android still starts

- Just restart the phone, and see if Android still works
