### Prepare everything

- Download **UFPTool** and extract the file's contents somewhere.

- Once you have acquired an .FFU file, place it in the same folder with **UFPTool**.

### Booting into FFU mode

- Reboot into UEFI and hold the `volume up` button until the QR code and wrench icons appear on the screen.

### Flashing the FFU Image

- Open `ffu.cmd` file from **UFPTool** folder

- Wait until the FFU image has flashed and the green check mark appears, after which your phone should reboot to Windows or Android.

> [!Note]
> If it does not boot into Android, reboot into recovery by holding the **volume up** + **power** buttons, and do a factory reset there.
